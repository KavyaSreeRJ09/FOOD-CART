The project is ideally a food cart web app in which one can order the food items that they want.
This project eliminates the hassle of going out and buying food, instead one can order food at the tip of their finger.

The project has two sides:
Customer
Admin
The admin side deals with the insertion and deletion of the food items.
The Customer side deals with ordering of the food items.

Each side has a login page which is actually a session bean page.
Then, the customer side has the register page.
After that the customer is taken to the menu to order food.
Meanwhile, the user is taken to a page where he/she is asked to insert or delete the food items.

The admin then chooses to delete or insert the food item
Either so, he/she must give the id and name of the food items 
So, when given it is deleted/ inserted

So, in the customer page, after the food is ordered, the customer is taken to the payment page. 
In which, he/she can proceed to pay with their debit/credit cards.
